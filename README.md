### About Me ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aaditya Prasad and My name is Aaditya Prasad but I normally go by Aadi. My research interests are centered around the synergy between computational neuroscience and deep learning. Specifically, I focus on developing deep learning based tools and models for understanding the cognitive principles underlying the brainâ€™s learning algorithms which I hope can inspire novel, robust deep learning systems. I just graduated from the University of California, San Diego in bioinformatics and I will be joining the HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Instituteâ€™s first Masterâ€™s in data science cohort. I am currently co-mentored by Talmo Pereira and Uri Manor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where I will be continuing for my thesis. After my masters, I hope to complete a PhD in computational neuroscience in order to become a research scientist at a start-up as well as an adjunct professor at a public university. To that end, I am currently open to and actively seeking research internships in data science, deep learning and neuroscience. My current resumÃ© can be found in the CV section of this website or [here](https://aaprasad.github.io/files/Aaditya_Prasad_Resume.pdf) in pdf format. If you want to talk about my research, potential fits in your company/group, collaborations, or just want to chat about anything from video games to philosophy, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out on twitter [@aadiprasad42](https://twitter.com/aadiprasad42) or by my email [aadityaprasad2001@gmail.com](mailto:aadityaprasad2001@gmail.com)!
