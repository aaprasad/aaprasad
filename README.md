### About Me ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aaditya Prasad but I normally go by Aadi. My research interests are centered around the synergy between computational neuroscience and deep learning. Specifically, I focus on developing deep learning based tools and models for understanding the cognitive principles underlying the brainâ€™s learning algorithms which I hope can in turn inspire novel, robust deep learning systems. Starting in 2024, I became a PhD student in [the Brain & Cognitive Sciences Department at MIT](https://bcs.mit.edu). Previously, I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a masters in data science in 2024 and a bachelors in bioinformatics in 2022 where I was co-mentored by [Talmo Pereira](https:/talmolab.org) and [Uri Manor](https://manorlab.ucsd.edu). There, I worked on [deep learning models of the visual cortex](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KIlSyKTulXO) as well as [biological multiple object tracking](https://github.com/talmolab/dreem). After my PhD, I hope to become a research scientist in industry as well as an adjunct professor at a public university. To that end, I am currently open to and actively seeking research internships in data science, deep learning and neuroscience. My current resumÃ© can be found in the CV section of [my personal website](https://aaprasad.github.io/cv/) or [here](https://aaprasad.github.io/files/Aaditya_Prasad_Resume.pdf) in pdf format. If you want to talk about my research, potential fits in your company/group, collaborations, or just want to chat about anything from video games to philosophy, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out by my email [aadityaprasad2001@gmail.com](mailto:aadityaprasad2001@gmail.com)!
